# 🛡️ Ghostline VPN — Flutter VPN App

A modern VPN client built with Flutter and Kotlin. Ghostline VPN connects to [VPNGate](https://www.vpngate.net/) servers in real time, allowing users to browse securely while viewing connection status, server info, and IP changes directly in the app.

> 🔧 This project is based on [nizwar/openvpn_flutter](https://github.com/nizwar/openvpn_flutter), with significant enhancements and native integration.

| Layer         | Technology                            |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| Frontend      | Flutter (Dart)                         |
| Native Layer  | Kotlin (Android VPN Integration)       |
| VPN Protocol  | OpenVPN via `de.blinkt.openvpn` lib    |
| API           | [VPNGate API](https://www.vpngate.net/api/iphone/) |
| IP Lookup     | IP-API / Public IP services (on demand) |

## 🧠 How It Works

- VPN servers are fetched dynamically from VPNGate's public JSON endpoint.
- When a server is selected, its `.ovpn` config is decoded and passed to the native Android layer.
- Native code uses the OpenVPN3 library (`de.blinkt.openvpn`) to initiate the VPN tunnel.
- Once connected, the app polls for the new public IP and displays live status updates.
